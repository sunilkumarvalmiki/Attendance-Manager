## 🎯 Quick Fix Solutions

### Solution 1: Update Tasker (RECOMMENDED)
The XML file requires **Tasker 6.0+**. Your current version may be outdated.

**Steps:**
1. Open Google Play Store
2. Search for "Tasker"
3. If "Update" button shows → Click it
4. Wait for update to complete
5. Retry import

**OR Join Beta for Latest Version:**
1. Visit: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.dinglisch.android.taskerm
2. Click "Become a Tester"
3. Update Tasker from Play Store
4. Retry import

---

### Solution 2: Import Tasks Individually (WORKAROUND)
If updating doesn't work, import tasks one by one instead of the entire project.

**You'll need to:**
1. Import each task separately
2. Manually create profiles
3. Link tasks to profiles

**I can create individual task XML files for you - let me know!**

---

### Solution 3: Compatibility Mode Version

I'll create a **simplified XML** compatible with older Tasker versions (5.x+).

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Works on older Tasker versions
- ❌ May lack some advanced features
- ❌ Needs manual profile setup

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic Steps

### Check Your Tasker Version
1. Open Tasker
2. Tap 3-dot menu (top right)
3. **Preferences** → **UI** tab
4. Scroll to bottom → See "Tasker Version X.X.X"
5. **Required:** Version 6.0 or higher

### Check AutoInput Installation
1. Open Play Store
2. Search "AutoInput"
3. Verify installed (required for automation)
4. If not installed → Install ($2.50)

## 🛠️ Alternative Import Methods

### Method 1: Direct File Transfer (Android)
1. Download `BeehiveAttendance.prj.xml` to **Downloads** folder
2. Open Tasker
3. Long-press **Projects** tab
4. Select **Import**
5. Navigate to Downloads → Select XML file

### Method 2: Cloud Sync Import
1. Upload XML to Google Drive
2. Open Drive on Android
3. Download file → Opens in Tasker automatically

### Method 3: Manual Recreation (Last Resort)
If all else fails, I can provide:
- Step-by-step manual task creation guide
- Screenshots for each action
- Copy-paste ready action parameters
